# Project Setup

This project is a clone of nader's nft marketplace 
https://dev.to/dabit3/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb

To get the project running run:

npm install
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Make sure the constants in config.js match what you get from running the deploy script.

```
